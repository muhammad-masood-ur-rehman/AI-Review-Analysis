# 🧠 AI-Powered Customer Review Insights

## 📌 Overview
E-commerce platforms receive thousands of customer reviews daily.  
These reviews contain valuable feedback about:
- Product quality
- Delivery experience
- App functionality
- Support responsiveness

Manually analyzing them is **time-consuming, error-prone, and unscalable**.  

This project transforms **unstructured customer reviews** into **structured, machine-readable insights** using **LLM-powered extraction (OpenRouter GPT API)**.  
These insights can power dashboards for **Product** and **Operations teams**, enabling faster decisions.
